Task 2: Install CI Server and setup deployment process on CI Server

User Story: As a member of the website development team, I want a structured process for continuous improvement, so that we can 
identify and address areas for improvement across the website development process and continuously improve 
our website's performance and user experience.

Description:
Install and configure a Continuous Integration (CI) server, and set up a deployment process on the CI server to

and validation steps to ensure that code changes are deployed to production only after passing a set of 
predefined criteria.
