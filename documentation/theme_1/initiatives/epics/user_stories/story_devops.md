# User Story: Incorporating Continuous Integration

## Description
As a development team member, I want to incorporate Continuous Integration (CI) into our software development process, so that we can identify and address code errors and conflicts earlier in the development cycle.
Acceptance Criteria:

## Acceptance Criteria:

* A CI server should be set up and configured to run builds automatically when code changes are pushed to the repository.
* The CI system should perform automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests, on the code changes to identify errors and conflicts.
* The CI system should send notifications to the development team when a build fails or when new code is merged into the main branch.
* The CI system should provide reports and logs of the test results and build status for tracking and analysis.
* The CI system should be integrated with the version control system used by the development team.
