# Task: Setting up WatchTower

## User Story:
As a member of the DevOps team, I want to set up WatchTower to monitor the CI/CD pipeline and receive notifications in case of failures or issues, so that we can quickly identify and fix any problems.

## Description:
Set up WatchTower, a tool for monitoring the CI/CD pipeline and alerting the team in case of failures or issues.

## Effort Estimate:
The estimated effort for setting up WatchTower will depend on the complexity of the pipeline and the number of services and environments involved, but it is likely to be around 10-15 hours.

## Assigned To:
Tejkumar Patel

## Priority:
The priority of this task is high as it is essential for ensuring the reliability and stability of the CI/CD pipeline, which is critical for delivering high-quality software.

## Status:
Not started

## Notes:
* WatchTower should be set up to monitor all stages of the pipeline, from code commits to production deployments.
* The notifications should be configured to be sent to the appropriate team members, such as developers or operations personnel, depending on the type and severity of the issue.
* The WatchTower setup should be documented and maintained to ensure that it remains up to date and effective in detecting and alerting issues.
* The task may require the involvement of multiple team members, including a DevOps engineer and a developer familiar with the pipeline.
* The task may also require access to the pipeline tools and services, as well as credentials and permissions to set up and configure WatchTower.
* Testing and validation of the WatchTower setup should be performed to ensure that it is working correctly and providing accurate and timely alerts.
