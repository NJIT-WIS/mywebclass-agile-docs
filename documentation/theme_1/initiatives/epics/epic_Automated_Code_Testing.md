# Epic: Automated Code Testing

Description: 
This epic aims to establish a process for automated code testing to ensure the quality of our software products. Automated code testing will help us detect and fix issues early on, resulting in higher quality products and increased customer satisfaction.

Goals:
- Improve the overall quality of our software products by detecting and fixing issues early on in the development process
- Reduce development time and costs by identifying and fixing issues early on in the development process
- Establish a culture of continuous improvement and learning within our development team

User Stories:

- [As a developer, I want to be able to write automated tests for my code, so that I can detect and fix issues early on.](https://github.com/GraceBurke-88/mywebclass-agile-docs/blob/main/documentation/theme_1/initiatives/epics/stories/Automated_Code_Testing.md)
- [As a development manager, I want to be able to track the progress of automated testing, so that I can ensure that it is being done effectively.](https://github.com/GraceBurke-88/mywebclass-agile-docs/blob/main/documentation/theme_1/initiatives/epics/stories/track_the_progress_of_automated_testing.md)

Dependencies:
- Availability of resources to develop and implement the automated testing process
- Team members being trained on writing automated tests

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Lack of buy-in from team members on the importance of automated testing
  Mitigation: Educate team members on the benefits of automated testing and involve them in the development of the automated testing process.
- Risk: Ineffective automated testing process
  Mitigation: Conduct regular reviews of the automated testing process and make necessary updates and improvements.

Estimated Effort: 6 months

Business Value:
- Increased customer satisfaction due to higher quality products
- Reduced development time and costs
- Improved efficiency and effectiveness of the development process

Priority: High
