# Epic: Monitoring Quality of Code

Description: 
This epic aims to improve the quality of our code by establishing a process for monitoring code quality throughout the development lifecycle of our software products. By monitoring code quality, we can identify and fix issues early on, leading to higher quality products and increased customer satisfaction.

Goals:
- Improve the overall quality of our software products by detecting and fixing code issues early on
- Increase customer satisfaction by delivering high-quality products that are reliable and efficient
- Reduce development time and costs by identifying and fixing issues early on in the development process
- Establish a culture of continuous improvement and learning within our development team

User Stories:
- As a developer, I want to integrate code quality monitoring tools into our development workflow so that I can identify and fix issues early on in the development process.
- As a project manager, I want to establish a standardized process for monitoring code quality so that I can ensure the quality of our software products.
- As a QA specialist, I want to develop and implement a set of metrics for monitoring code quality so that I can measure the effectiveness of our code quality monitoring process.
- As a developer, I want to receive training on the code quality monitoring process and tools so that I can effectively monitor the quality of my code.

Dependencies:
- Availability of resources to develop and implement the code quality monitoring process
- Adoption of the code quality monitoring process by team members

Risks and Mitigation Strategies:
- Risk: Lack of buy-in from team members
  Mitigation: Educate team members on the benefits of monitoring code quality and involve them in the development of the code quality monitoring process.
- Risk: Ineffective tools and metrics for monitoring code quality
  Mitigation: Conduct regular reviews of the tools and metrics and make necessary updates and improvements.

Estimated Effort: 6 sprints

Business Value:
- Increased customer satisfaction
- Improved overall quality of our software products
- More efficient and effective development process

Priority: High
