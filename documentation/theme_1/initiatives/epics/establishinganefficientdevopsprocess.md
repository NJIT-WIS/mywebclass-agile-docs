# Epic: Establishing an Efficient DevOps Process

Description: This epic focuses on selecting and implementing the appropriate DevOps tools and practices to establish an efficient development pipeline for the MyWebClass.org website. The objective is to automate the software delivery process, define a release management process, set up a monitoring and logging system, and create a disaster recovery plan.

Goals:
Select and implement appropriate DevOps tools and practices to establish an efficient development pipeline.
Define a release management process that ensures the quality and stability of the product before release.
Set up a monitoring and logging system that provides insights into the performance and usage of the website.
Create a disaster recovery plan that ensures the continuity of the project in the event of a catastrophic failure.

User Stories:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to research and evaluate various DevOps tools and practices that will help establish an efficient development pipeline.
As a software developer, I want to integrate version control into the development process to enable collaboration and enable the use of automated testing and CI/CD.

Dependencies:
The selection and implementation of appropriate DevOps tools and practices.
Availability of the team members to collaborate on implementing the DevOps process.
Budget and time constraints.

Risks:
