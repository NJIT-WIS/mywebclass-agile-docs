Task Title: Implement CI/CD tools

User Story: As a developer, I want to implement CI/CD tools to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, so that I can deliver high-quality software more quickly and reliably.

Description: This task involves implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools to automate the software development process. The acceptance criteria for this task are:

Implement a CI tool to automate the build and test processes on code changes.
Implement a CD tool to automate the deployment process to staging and production environments.
Create a pipeline that executes the CI/CD processes automatically when a new code change is pushed to the repository.
Integrate code quality tools, such as static analysis, code coverage, and code formatting checks, into the pipeline to ensure high-quality code.
Ensure that the pipeline is configured to run on a dedicated build server or cloud-based environment to avoid interfering with developers' local environments.
Ensure that the pipeline includes notifications and alerts to inform developers of build and deployment failures.
Document the CI/CD process and provide guidelines for using it.
Effort Estimate: 40 hours

Assigned To: DevOps Engineer

Priority: High

Status: In Progress

Notes: The DevOps Engineer will need to work closely with the development team to ensure that the CI/CD pipeline is configured correctly for the application's specific needs. They will also need to collaborate with the IT operations team to ensure that the pipeline is integrated with existing infrastructure and processes.
