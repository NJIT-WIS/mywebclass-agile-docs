As a development manager, I want to be able to track the progress of automated testing, so that I can ensure that it is being done effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The testing progress can be viewed through a dashboard that displays the number of automated tests completed and the number of tests remaining.
- The dashboard should also display the overall success rate of the automated tests.
- The dashboard should provide the ability to filter the testing results by date range, test suite, or test outcome.
- The dashboard should be accessible to authorized users only.
- The testing progress should be updated in real-time and reflect the latest results.
