# User Story: Automated Code Testing

As a developer, I want to be able to write automated tests for my code, so that I can detect and fix issues early on.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The automated tests cover all critical paths and functionality of the code.
- The automated tests run automatically after every code change.
- The automated tests produce clear and actionable feedback in case of a failure.
- The automated tests are maintained and updated as the codebase evolves.
- The automated testing framework used is appropriate for the programming language and technology stack used in the project.
