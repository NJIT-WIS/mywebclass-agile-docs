As a developer, I want to integrate code quality monitoring tools into our development workflow so that I can identify and fix issues early on in the development process.

Acceptance Criteria:

Code quality monitoring tools are integrated into the development workflow and can be run automatically as part of the build process.
The tools generate actionable reports that identify specific issues and suggest ways to fix them.
Developers are notified promptly of any code quality issues, with enough information to diagnose and fix the issues.
