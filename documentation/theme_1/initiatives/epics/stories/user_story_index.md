## User Story: index.html

As a user, I want to be able to access the MyWebClass website easily and navigate to different pages, so that I can learn about web development and access helpful resources.

When I visit the MyWebClass website, I want to see a clear and organized navigation menu at the top of the page, which includes links to the homepage, articles page, and installation instructions page.

When I click on a link in the navigation menu, I want to be taken to the corresponding page quickly and without any errors.

Additionally, I would like the website to be optimized for different screen sizes, so that I can access the website from my computer, tablet, or smartphone without any problems.

Finally, I would appreciate it if the website includes relevant meta information, such as a description and keywords, which will help me find the website through search engines.
