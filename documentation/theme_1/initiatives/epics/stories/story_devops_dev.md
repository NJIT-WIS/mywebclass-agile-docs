As a developer, I want to use a version control system to manage webpage code and collaborate with other developers.

Acceptance Criteria:

The version control system is implemented and integrated with the web development process.
All code changes and updates are tracked and stored in the version control system.
Developers are able to easily collaborate on the codebase using the version control system.
Any conflicts or merge issues are resolved effectively using the version control system.
The version control system is regularly backed up to prevent data loss or corruption.
