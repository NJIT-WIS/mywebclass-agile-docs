# Task Title: Set up Version Control for the Project

User Story: User Story 2: As a software developer, I want to integrate version control into the development process to enable collaboration and enable the use of automated testing and CI/CD.


Description: The task involves selecting an appropriate version control system (e.g. Git, SVN) for the project and setting it up. The system will need to be configured with appropriate permissions and access controls. All developers will need to be trained on how to use the system effectively, and any existing code will need to be migrated to the new system.

Effort Estimate: 6 hours

Assigned To: John, Senior Software Developer

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Tests:
Test that the selected version control system is set up and configured with the appropriate permissions and access controls.
Test that all developers are trained on how to use the system effectively and can effectively track their code changes.
Test that any existing code is successfully migrated to the new version control system.

Notes:
This task is dependent on the completion of the research and evaluation of different version control systems.
