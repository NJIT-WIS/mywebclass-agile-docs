# User Story 2:
As a software developer, I want to integrate version control into the development process to enable collaboration and enable the use of automated testing and CI/CD.

Acceptance Criteria:
A version control system is identified and set up for the project.
All developers are trained on how to use the version control system effectively, and all code changes are tracked and stored in the system.
