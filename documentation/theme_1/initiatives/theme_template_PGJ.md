To establish a highly visible web presence, focus should be on maximizing user benefits. In order to do this, identifying user needs 
is absolutely necessary. We need to start by identifying the needs and expectations of the users. Some of the methods that we can use
are techniques like user testing to get a better understanding of what our users are looking for. By Applying agile and lean principle,
we can create tests, such as, Customer Validation Testing, Beta Testing, and Usability Testing. This allows us to make less mistake 
on initiating things and responses from the users can quickly translate into trials for further testing. This gives us the data that 
will ultimately benefit long-term wise. We should be ones asking the question!
