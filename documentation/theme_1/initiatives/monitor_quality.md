# Title of the Initiative: Monitoring Quality of Code

## Description
This initiative aims to establish a process for monitoring the quality of code throughout the development lifecycle of our software products. By monitoring the quality of our code, we can identify and fix issues early on, which will ultimately result in higher quality products and increased customer satisfaction.

Automated testing will be done using pytest for unit testing and Playwright for end-to-end testing. Manual testing will be used as necessary for themes, epics, and initiatives. However, user stories and tasks will rely mostly on automated testing.

## Goals
- Improve the overall quality of our software products by detecting and fixing code issues early on
- Increase customer satisfaction by delivering high-quality products that are reliable and efficient
- Reduce development time and costs by identifying and fixing issues early on in the development process
- Establish a culture of continuous improvement and learning within our development team

## Scope
- This initiative will cover all software products developed by our team
- The process for monitoring code quality will be integrated into our existing development workflow

## Outcomes
- A standardized process for monitoring code quality that is integrated into our development workflow
- A reduction in the number of code issues identified in production
- Improved overall quality of our software products
- Increased customer satisfaction
- A more efficient and effective development process

## Deliverables
- A code quality monitoring process document
- A set of tools and metrics for monitoring code quality
- A training program for developers on the code quality monitoring process and tools

## Milestones
- Establish a code quality baseline for each software product (Q2 2023)
- Develop and implement the code quality monitoring process (Q3 2023)
- Roll out the code quality monitoring process to all software products (Q4 2023)
- Conduct training sessions for developers on the code quality monitoring process and tools (Q1 2024)

## Constraints
- Limited resources for implementing the code quality monitoring process
- Limited buy-in from some team members on the importance of monitoring code quality

## Assumptions
- Team members will be willing to adopt the code quality monitoring process
- The tools and metrics for monitoring code quality will be effective in identifying issues early on

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Risk: Lack of buy-in from team members
  Mitigation: Educate team members on the benefits of monitoring code quality and involve them in the development of the code quality monitoring process
- Risk: Ineffective tools and metrics for monitoring code quality
  Mitigation: Conduct regular reviews of the tools and metrics and make necessary updates and improvements

## Dependencies
- Availability of resources to develop and implement the code quality monitoring process

## Team
- Project Manager: Jane Smith
- Development Team: 5 developers
