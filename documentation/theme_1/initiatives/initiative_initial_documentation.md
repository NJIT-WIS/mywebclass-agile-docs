# Initiative: Develop Initial Project Plan and Documentation
## Description
This initiative is to write up the initial documentation and plan for the development of the "My Web Class" website. 
## Goals
The goal of this initiative is to have a plan in the form of documentation so we have direction on how we want to build out this website. The draft should be based on the principles of the Agile Manifesto and Lean. 
## Scope
For the initial draft, the project should be broken down and organized into themes, initiatives, epics, users stories, and tasks. This break down is based on standard terms within agile. 
## Outcomes
The outcome of this initiative is to have documentation that can be followed to begin initial development on the "My Web Class" website.
