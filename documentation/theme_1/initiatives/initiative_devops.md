# Creating a Continuous Integration/ Continous Deployment Setup With DevOps
<!--fix spelling on word "continous" -->
## Description:
* The initiative is focused on creating a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup with DevOps for a software development project. The aim is to automate the software build, test, and deployment process to improve the speed, quality, and efficiency of software development. This initiative requires collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams to integrate and automate the development process.

## Goals:
The primary goals of this initiative are as follows:

* Automate the build, test, and deployment process of software.
* Improve the quality and speed of software development.
* Reduce manual errors in the software development process.
* Facilitate faster and more frequent releases of software.
* Enhance collaboration and communication between development, testing, and operations teams.

## Scope:
The initiative includes the following components:

* Designing and implementing a CI/CD pipeline with DevOps tools and technologies.
* Configuring and integrating DevOps tools and technologies.
* Automating the software build, test, and deployment process.
* Setting up the infrastructure to support the CI/CD pipeline.
* Training and educating team members on using the new CI/CD setup.

## Outcomes:
The following outcomes are expected from the initiative:

* Improved quality, speed, and efficiency of software development.
* Automated software build, test, and deployment process.
* Reduced manual errors in the software development process.
* Faster and more frequent releases of software.
* Enhanced collaboration and communication between development, testing, and operations teams.

## Deliverables:
The following deliverables will be provided at the end of the initiative:

* CI/CD pipeline design and implementation documentation.
* Configured and integrated DevOps tools and technologies.
* Automated software build, test, and deployment process.
* Infrastructure setup documentation.
* Training and education materials for team members.

## Milestones:
The following milestones will be achieved during the initiative:

* Design and planning phase completed.
* DevOps tools and technologies selected and configured.
* CI/CD pipeline implemented and tested.
* Infrastructure set up to support the CI/CD pipeline.
* Team members trained and educated on using the new CI/CD setup.

## Constraints:
The following constraints have been identified:

* Limited budget for purchasing DevOps tools and technologies.
* Limited resources available for infrastructure setup.
* Limited time frame for implementing the CI/CD pipeline.

## Assumptions:
The following assumptions have been made:

* Team members have basic knowledge of software development and DevOps.
* Infrastructure resources are available to support the CI/CD pipeline.
* DevOps tools and technologies can be integrated with the existing software development process.
* Team members are willing to adapt to the new CI/CD setup.

## Risks:
The following risks have been identified and need to be mitigated:

* Lack of knowledge and expertise in using DevOps tools and technologies.
* Integration issues between DevOps tools and technologies.
* Inadequate infrastructure to support the CI/CD pipeline.
* Resistance to change from team members.

## Dependencies:
The following dependencies have been identified:

* Availability of DevOps tools and technologies.
* Availability of infrastructure resources to support the CI/CD pipeline.
* Cooperation and collaboration between development, testing, and operations teams.
* Timely delivery of training and education materials.

## Team:
The following roles are needed to execute this initiative:

* Project Manager - responsible for overall management and coordination of the initiative.
* DevOps Engineer - responsible for designing and implementing the CI/CD pipeline.
* Infrastructure Engineer - responsible for setting up the infrastructure to support the CI/CD pipeline.
* Development Team - responsible for integrating the CI/CD
