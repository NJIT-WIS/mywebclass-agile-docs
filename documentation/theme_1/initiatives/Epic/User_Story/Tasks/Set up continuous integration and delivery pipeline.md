2.	Task Title: Set up continuous integration and delivery pipeline 
User Story: The continuous integration and delivery pipeline is set up and integrated with the version control system. The pipeline automatically tests, builds, and deploys the software, and notifications are sent to relevant team members upon success or failure. 
Description: This task involves setting up a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that integrates with the version control system. The pipeline should automatically run tests, build the software, and deploy it to a staging environment. Notifications should be sent to relevant team members upon success or failure of the pipeline. Dependencies include having a version control system already set up and having the necessary tools and resources to set up the CI/CD pipeline. 
Effort Estimate: 16 hours 
Assigned To: John 
Priority: High 
Status: In progress 
Tests:
1.	Manual test: Manually trigger a code deployment to the staging environment using the CI/CD pipeline and verify that the deployment was successful.
2.	Automated test: Run automated tests through the pipeline and verify that they pass successfully. Notes: It's important to ensure that the pipeline is reliable and can handle different types of tests and deployment scenarios.
