1.	As a software developer, I want to collaborate more effectively with my team by using a version control system so that we can manage changes and work on code together without conflicts. 

Acceptance Criteria:
•	The version control system is set up and accessible to all team members.
•	All changes to the code are tracked and can be easily reviewed and reverted if necessary.
2.	As a project manager, I want to implement a continuous integration and delivery pipeline using a suitable tool, so that we can automate testing, build and deploy software with confidence, and avoid human errors. Acceptance Criteria:
•	The continuous integration and delivery pipeline is set up and integrated with the version control system.
•	The pipeline automatically tests, builds, and deploys the software, and notifications are sent to relevant team members upon success or failure.
