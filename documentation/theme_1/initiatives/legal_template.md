## Test plan
The test plan for the legal requirements of Webclass.org should include a checklist of all legal requirements that need to be fulfilled, a list of test cases to ensure each requirement is met, and a schedule for conducting the tests. The test plan should also include a report format to document test results and identify any areas of non-compliance that need to be addressed.
