# Initiative: Create a Basic Project Plan and Project Management Documentation

### Description: 
This initiative involves creating a comprehensive project plan and project management documentation to guide the development and implementation of the MyWebClass website.

### Goals:

Develop a clear and concise project plan that outlines the project scope, goals, objectives, timeline, and resource requirements</br>
Create project management documentation that includes a risk management plan, communication plan, quality assurance plan, and change management plan
Ensure that the project plan and documentation are aligned with the overall business strategy and objectives

### Scope: 
This initiative will cover the development of a comprehensive project plan and project management documentation that will guide the MyWebClass website development team throughout the project lifecycle.

To structure our project planning, we'll use themes, initiatives, epics, user stories, and tasks aligned with our strategic goals. We aim to minimize "push" by using automated testing for user stories and tasks. We'll measure effectiveness with metrics aligned with our goals, following lean development principles for continuous improvement.

### Outcomes:

A well-defined project plan that will guide the development and implementation of the MyWebClass website</br>
Comprehensive project management documentation that outlines the risk management plan, communication plan, quality assurance plan, and change management plan</br>
Alignment of the project plan and documentation with the overall business strategy and objectives

### Deliverables:

Project plan document that outlines the project scope, goals, objectives, timeline, and resource requirements</br>
Project management documentation that includes a risk management plan, communication plan, quality assurance plan, and change management plan

### Milestones:

1. Completion of the project plan within two weeks</br>
2. Completion of the project management documentation within three weeks</br>
3. Constraints: Limited resources and tight deadlines may impact the completion of this initiative.</br>

### Assumptions:

The development team is available to collaborate on the project plan and project management documentation</br>
The project plan and documentation will be approved by relevant stakeholders

### Risks:

Delays in the development of the project plan and project management documentation may impact the overall project timeline</br>
Inadequate project planning and management may lead to cost overruns and quality issues</br>

### Dependencies: 
None

### Team:

Project Manager: Responsible for overseeing the development of the project plan and project management documentation</br>
Development Team: Collaborate on the development of the project plan and project management documentation.
