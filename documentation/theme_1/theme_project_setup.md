# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our project, MyWebClass, is a website that requires a development team to work together in parallel to produce various content that supports the objectives of the site. To start our project off using the "pull" approach to development, we will only focus on creating a basic web template that addresses any legal requirements that are relevant to our project, can be found using a search engine, allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner.The following are three major pieces that the project will need to focus on:


Basic Project Documentation and Project Management:

-Define the project scope, goals, objectives, and deliverables.

-Identify the stakeholders and their requirements.

-Create a project plan that includes timelines, milestones, and dependencies.

-Set up communication channels and reporting mechanisms.

-Define the roles and responsibilities of the team members.

-Develop a risk management plan to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks.


DevOps:

-Select and implement the appropriate DevOps tools and practices that support the development of the project, such as version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated testing.

-Establish a development pipeline that automates the software delivery process, from code commit to deployment.

-Define a release management process that ensures the quality and stability of the product before release.

-Set up a monitoring and logging system that provides insights into the performance and usage of the website.

-Define a disaster recovery plan that ensures the continuity of the project in the event of a catastrophic failure.



MyWebClass.org base website template with all technical and legal requirements satisfied to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in a search engine by implementing the basic on page SEO requirements.

-Develop a website template that meets the defined requirements, such as legal compliance, Google Analytics integration, and validation standards.

-Implement basic on-page SEO requirements to ensure the website can be appropriately listed in search engines.

-Test the website template thoroughly to ensure it meets the defined requirements and is user-friendly.

-Launch the initial 0.1.0 release of the website template and continue to iterate based on user feedback and data insights gathered through Google Analytics.


By executing this plan, the project team can successfully create a MyWebClass.org website template that meets all technical and legal requirements to use Google Analytics and can be appropriately listed in search engines. The DevOps process ensures that the project is efficiently managed and that the website is continuously delivered with high quality and stability.

## Initiative(s)
*  Basic Project Documentation and Project Management (initiatives/Base Project Documentation and Management.md)
* DevOps (initiatives/devops.md)
* MyWebClass.org base website template with all technical and legal requirements satisfied to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in a search engine by implementing the basic on page SEO requirements. (initiatives/SEO Requirements.md)

* Monitoring to continuously improve the quality of our project
  * Website analytics to collect data that can be used to continuously improve MyWebClass for our community members
  * Project metrics to continuously improve the management of the project

## Test plan
Create a playwright test for all legal requirements:
The development team can create automated tests using playwright to ensure that the website template meets all legal requirements, such as GDPR compliance, accessibility, and copyright infringement.
The team can write test cases for each requirement and execute the tests to ensure that the website passes all legal compliance requirements.
Test that Google Analytics is tracking MyWebClass.org:
The development team can create a test case to verify that Google Analytics is properly tracking user behavior on the website.
The team can create a unique event or pageview in Google Analytics and ensure that it is being tracked when a user interacts with the website.
The team can also verify that Google Analytics is properly configured and implemented on the website by checking the analytics code and tracking tags.
Once the tests are created, they can be executed using an automated testing tool such as Selenium or by manually running the tests on different browsers and devices. The results of the tests can be recorded and analyzed to identify any issues or bugs in the website template or analytics implementation. Any issues or bugs that are identified can be fixed by the development team, and the tests can be re-executed to ensure that the issues have been resolved. The process of testing and fixing issues can be repeated until the website template meets all defined requirements and is ready for launch.
