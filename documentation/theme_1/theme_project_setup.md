# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our project, MyWebClass, is a website that requires a development team to work together in parallel to produce various content that supports the objectives of the site. To start our project off using the "pull" approach to development, we will only focus on creating a basic web template that addresses any legal requirements that are relevant to our project, can be found using a search engine, allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner.The following are three major pieces that the project will need to focus on:


Basic Project Documentation and Project Management:

-Define the project scope, goals, objectives, and deliverables.

-Identify the stakeholders and their requirements.

-Create a project plan that includes timelines, milestones, and dependencies.

-Set up communication channels and reporting mechanisms.

-Define the roles and responsibilities of the team members.

-Develop a risk management plan to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks.

Metrics to track success:
User engagement metrics: These could include metrics such as time spent on site, bounce rate, and pages per session. By tracking these metrics, the project team can identify areas of the site that are performing well and areas that may need improvement in order to keep users engaged and on the site.

Conversion metrics: Depending on the goals of the site, the project team may want to track conversion metrics such as sign-ups, purchases, or other actions that indicate users are taking desired actions on the site. By tracking these metrics, the team can identify areas of the site that may need to be optimized to improve conversion rates.

Traffic sources: By tracking where traffic to the site is coming from (such as search engines, social media, or referral sites), the project team can better understand how to target their marketing efforts and where to focus their resources.

Performance metrics: These could include metrics such as page load times, server response times, and error rates. By tracking these metrics, the team can identify areas of the site that may need to be optimized for speed and performance in order to improve the user experience.

Bug and issue tracking: By keeping track of bugs and issues that are reported by users or discovered through testing, the project team can prioritize and address these issues to ensure that the site is functioning as intended and providing a good user experience.


DevOps:

-Select and implement the appropriate DevOps tools and practices that support the development of the project, such as version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated testing.

-Establish a development pipeline that automates the software delivery process, from code commit to deployment.

-Define a release management process that ensures the quality and stability of the product before release.

-Set up a monitoring and logging system that provides insights into the performance and usage of the website.

-Define a disaster recovery plan that ensures the continuity of the project in the event of a catastrophic failure.



MyWebClass.org base website template with all technical and legal requirements satisfied to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in a search engine by implementing the basic on page SEO requirements.

-Develop a website template that meets the defined requirements, such as legal compliance, Google Analytics integration, and validation standards.

-Implement basic on-page SEO requirements to ensure the website can be appropriately listed in search engines.

-Test the website template thoroughly to ensure it meets the defined requirements and is user-friendly.

-Launch the initial 0.1.0 release of the website template and continue to iterate based on user feedback and data insights gathered through Google Analytics.


By executing this plan, the project team can successfully create a MyWebClass.org website template that meets all technical and legal requirements to use Google Analytics and can be appropriately listed in search engines. The DevOps process ensures that the project is efficiently managed and that the website is continuously delivered with high quality and stability.
