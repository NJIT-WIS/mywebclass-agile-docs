## Overview
This project involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and tools for the development of a basic webpage, implementing a devops approach, and ensuring GDPR compliance.
## Initiative(s)

* [Development of a Basic webpage]("C:\Users\nicko\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\mywebclass-agile-docs\documentation\theme_1\initiatives\initiative_basic_webpage.md")
* [Setup of devops implementation]("C:\Users\nicko\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\mywebclass-agile-docs\documentation\theme_1\initiatives\initiative_devops_plan.md")
* [Set up GDPR compliance]("C:\Users\nicko\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\mywebclass-agile-docs\documentation\theme_1\initiatives\initiative_GDPR_comply.md")

* Development of a Basic Webpage
- Set up a development environment with the necessary tools for front-end and back-end development.
- Determine the scope of the webpage and define the features to be included.
- Design the webpage layout and user interface.
- Develop the webpage, test it, and deploy it to a staging environment for further testing.
* Setup of DevOps Implementation
- Set up a version control system for the project, such as Git.
- Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the project, using tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.
- Configure automated testing and deployment processes to ensure efficient and error-free deployment.
* Set up GDPR Compliance
- Conduct a thorough review of the project's data collection and processing practices to identify potential GDPR compliance issues.
- Implement technical and organizational measures to address any compliance issues, such as data encryption, access controls, and data deletion procedures.
- Provide GDPR training to relevant staff members to ensure that they understand and comply with GDPR regulations.

## Test plan
1. Development of a Basic Webpage
- Test the webpage's functionality and user interface on different devices and browsers.
- Conduct usability testing to identify any issues with the webpage's layout or user experience.
- Test the webpage's performance and load times to ensure that it can handle high traffic.
2. Setup of DevOps Implementation
- Test the CI/CD pipeline by making changes to the codebase and ensuring that the changes are deployed to the staging environment and production environment correctly.
- Test the automated testing and deployment processes to ensure that they are working as expected.
3. Set up GDPR Compliance
- Test the technical measures implemented for GDPR compliance, such as data encryption and access controls, to ensure that they are working correctly.
- Test the data deletion procedures to ensure that personal data can be deleted upon request.
- Conduct periodic audits to ensure ongoing compliance with GDPR regulations.
