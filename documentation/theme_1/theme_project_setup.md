* Usability Testing: Usability testing involves selecting a group of users and having them perform specific tasks on the website while being observed. This method can reveal areas of the website that are difficult to use, confusing, or frustrating for users.

* Performance Testing: Performance testing involves testing the website's response time and load capacity to ensure that it can handle the expected user traffic.

* Compatibility Testing: Compatibility testing involves testing the website's compatibility with different browsers, devices, and operating systems.

* Security Testing: Security testing involves testing the website's security measures to ensure that user data is protected and the website is not vulnerable to attacks.

* Accessibility Testing: Accessibility testing involves testing the website's accessibility to ensure that it is usable by people with disabilities.
