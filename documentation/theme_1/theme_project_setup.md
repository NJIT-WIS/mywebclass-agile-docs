# Theme 1.0: Project Setup

## Overview

Our objective is to establish a highly visible web presence using lean and agile principles to quickly and effectively develop a strong foundation for our web project. By completing the initiatives outlined in this theme, we can establish a solid foundation that ensures our web page meets our business requirements throughout the life of the project, setting us up for long-term success.

## Initiative(s)

- Develop initial project documentation to establish a clear project scope.

- Set up the CI/CD DevOps processes to ensure efficient and collaborative development practices.

- Create an initial web page template that includes:
  - Monitoring to continuously improve the quality of our project
  - Website analytics to collect data that can be used to continuously improve MyWebClass for our community members
  - Project metrics to continuously improve the management of the project

## Test Plan

The success of these initiatives will be measured by:

- The completion of the initial project documentation within the specified timeline.
- The successful implementation of CI/CD DevOps processes, as evidenced by faster feedback loops, quicker testing and deployment, and more reliable software releases.
- The successful creation and deployment of the web page template, as evidenced by positive feedback from Prudential's community members, improved website analytics, and project metrics.
