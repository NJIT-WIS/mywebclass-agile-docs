# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
As an IS601 student, I want to do this assignment so that I get a passing grade. By creating a web page template, we 
can establish the look of future articles and give them baseline content. This will enable us to "Empower Teachers to
Teach Software Development with Agility and Inclusion". By following Agile and lean processes, we can quickly and 
effectively ensure the page complies with GDPR requirements, monitor it to gauge effectiveness, & make it safe and 
accessible for all.
## Initiative(s)

* [Initiative 1: Ensure the page complies with GDPR Requirements.](initiatives/documentation_initiative.md)
* [Initiative 2: Make sure the page is ADA compliant.](initiatives/initiative_devops.md)
* [Initiative 3: Make sure the usage of the page can be monitored.](initiatives/initiative_webpage_template.md)

* Monitoring to continuously improve the quality of our project
  * Website analytics to collect data that can be used to continuously improve MyWebClass for our community members
  * Project metrics to continuously improve the management of the project

## Test plan
Testing will be done manually and/or through methods we haven't learned about yet.
