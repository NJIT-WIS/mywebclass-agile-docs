"Password reset Functionality"

Description: Password reset functionality allows registered users to reset their forgotten passwords by providing their registered email address. Once the email address is confirmed, a password reset link is sent to the user's email, which allows them to create a new password and regain access to their account. This functionality is essential to ensure that users can easily reset their passwords without any intervention from customer support, improving user experience and reducing the workload for the support team.

Goals: The primary goal of Password Reset Functionality is to provide a simple and secure way for registered users to reset their password in case they forget it or suspect unauthorized access to their account. The functionality should allow users to reset their password without requiring any assistance from the customer support team, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Constraints:
•	Security requirements: Password reset functionality involves sensitive user information, so there may be strict security requirements around the storage, transmission, and processing of this data. 
•	User authentication: In order to reset their password, users must be able to authenticate themselves, typically by providing their email address or other identifying information. This requires robust user authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
•	Email deliverability: The password reset link is typically sent to the user's email address, so there may be constraints around ensuring that these emails are delivered reliably and do not end up in spam folders or blocked by email providers.
•	User education: Password reset functionality is only useful if users know how to use it, so there may be constraints around providing clear and accessible instructions for resetting passwords and accessing the functionality.
•	Compatibility: The password reset functionality should be compatible with a variety of devices and browsers to ensure that all users can access it.


Assumptions: 
•	The user has access to the email associated with their account and can receive the password reset link.
•	The password reset link sent via email is valid for a limited amount of time to prevent unauthorized access.
•	The user can successfully navigate to the password reset page and complete the reset process.
•	The user has a strong internet connection to receive the password reset link and complete the reset process.
•	The email server used to send password reset links is reliable and secure.
•	The user has provided a valid email address associated with their account.


Risks: 
•	Password reset functionality may be susceptible to hacking or unauthorized access, leading to the theft of user data or sensitive information.
•	Email links or reset tokens may be intercepted or stolen, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.
•	Users may find the password reset process too complicated or confusing, leading to frustration and abandonment of the feature.
•	The password reset feature may be inaccessible to users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies.
•	The password reset feature may be incompatible with certain browsers, devices, or operating systems, leading to errors or malfunctioning.
•	The feature may experience performance issues or system crashes if a large number of users request password resets simultaneously.
•	Users may provide incorrect or invalid email addresses, leading to password reset links being sent to the wrong recipient.
•	Users may accidentally delete or discard password reset emails, leading to difficulties in resetting their password.
•	The password reset feature may fail to comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations, leading to legal or financial penalties.


Dependencies: 
•	Password reset functionality depends on the existence of a user authentication system that is working correctly.
•	Users must be able to access their account information and provide valid information to verify their identity.
•	Password reset functionality depends on the availability of an email service that can deliver emails to users without any issues.
•	Email service must be set up correctly and compatible with the system.
•	The password reset feature depends on a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and understand.
•	The interface should provide clear instructions to users on how to reset their password.
•	The password reset feature depends on compatibility with the existing system, including the database and backend components.
•	The feature should be compatible with different browsers, devices, and operating systems.
•	The success of the password reset feature depends on user awareness and knowledge of how to use it.
•	Users must be aware of the feature and understand its importance to account security.
