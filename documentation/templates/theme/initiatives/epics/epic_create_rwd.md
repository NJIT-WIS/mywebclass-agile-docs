# Create a Responsive Web Design

Description: This epic covers the value of building a website that is responsive.

Goals: 
* Improve user experience: One of the main goals of creating a responsive design is to improve the user experience by providing a consistent and user-friendly interface across all devices and screen sizes.
* Improve accessibility: Another main goal of RWD is to consider users with different abilities and to ensure a website can reach as many users as possible.

User Stories: 
* As a user, I want the website to be responsive, so that I can access it on any device and have a consistent experience.
* As a team member, I want to use a responsive web design framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation, so that we can build the website quickly and efficiently.

Dependencies:
* Selection of responsive design framework: Before implementing the responsive design, the team should select a responsive design framework to use, such as Bootstrap or Foundation. The framework should be chosen based on the website's specific requirements and the team's familiarity with the framework.
* Accessibility requirements: The team should be aware of accessibility requirements for responsive design, including providing alternatives for non-text content, making the website keyboard accessible, and ensuring that the website is compatible with assistive technologies.
* Browser compatibility testing: After implementing the responsive design, the team should test the website's compatibility with different browsers to ensure that the design works as expected on different devices and screen sizes.

Risks:
* Risk 1: Poor user experience on certain devices or screen sizes
* Mitigation Strategy: Conduct thorough user testing on a variety of devices and screen sizes to ensure that the website's design is responsive and user-friendly on all platforms.

* Risk 2: Increased development time and cost
* Mitigation Strategy: Use a responsive design framework or library to help speed up development and reduce costs. Additionally, ensure that the design guidelines and content strategy are clearly defined and agreed upon by all stakeholders to minimize delays or miscommunication.

* Risk 3: Compatibility issues with certain browsers or devices
* Mitigation Strategy: Test the website on a variety of browsers and devices to ensure compatibility. Consider using tools and services that can simulate different devices and browsers.

* Risk 4: Accessibility issues
* Mitigation Strategy: Follow accessibility guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), to ensure that the website is accessible to all users. Test the website with assistive technologies such as screen readers to ensure that all users can navigate the website.

* Risk 5: Inconsistent design
* Mitigation Strategy: Create a style guide that clearly defines the design elements, such as typography, color palette, and layout, to ensure consistency throughout the website. Train team members and stakeholders on the style guide to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Estimated Effort: 1-3 weeks
