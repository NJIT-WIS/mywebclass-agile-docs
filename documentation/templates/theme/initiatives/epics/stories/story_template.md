As a student, I want to have access to interactive learning activities that will help me better understand the course material.

By following this template, you can create user stories that are structured and easy to understand. To make the user story even more effective, you can add acceptance criteria that specify the requirements that must be met to consider the user story complete. Here's an example of a user story with acceptance criteria:

"As a customer, I want to view my order history so that I can track my past purchases."

Acceptance Criteria:

The documentation page should be accessible and viewable on all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
The page should be well-organized, with clear headings, subheadings, and paragraphs, to make it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need.
The content on the page should be up-to-date and accurate, reflecting the latest technologies and courses offered on Mywebclass.org.
The page should include step-by-step instructions and examples for how to use the various technologies and tools available on Mywebclass.org.
The page should include links to additional resources, such as videos, tutorials, and help forums, to provide users with more in-depth information and support.
