The password reset page should include clear and concise instructions on how to reset a password. The password reset page should include a form for users to enter their email address associated with their account. Upon submission of the email address, the system should verify the email address and send a password reset link to the user's email address. The password reset link should be valid for a limited amount of time (e.g., 24 hours) and expire after that time. The password reset link should take the user to a secure page where they can create a new password. The new password should meet the password policy requirements (e.g., minimum length, use of special characters, etc.). After successfully resetting the password, the user should be redirected to the login page with a message indicating that their password has been reset. The user should be able to log in with their new password and access their account information.

2.	As a registered user, I want to be able to enter my email address on the password reset page and receive an email with a password reset link so that I can reset my password.
Acceptance Criteria: The password reset page should include a form that allows the user to enter their email address associated with their account. Upon submission of the email address, the system should verify that the email address is associated with a registered user account. If the email address is associated with a registered user account, the system should send an email to the user's email address with a password reset link. The email should include clear and concise instructions on how to reset the password. The password reset link should be valid for a limited amount of time (e.g., 24 hours) and expire after that time. Clicking on the password reset link should take the user to a secure page where they can create a new password. The new password should meet the password policy requirements. After successfully resetting the password, the user should be redirected to the login page with a message indicating that their password has been reset. If the email address is not associated with a registered user account, the system should display an error message indicating that the email address is invalid or not found. The password reset functionality should be tested to ensure that it is working as expected and providing a positive user experience.

3.	As a registered user, I want to be able to click on the password reset link in the email and be taken to a page where I can enter a new password.
Acceptance Criteria: The password reset link in the email should be clickable and take the user to a dedicated password reset page. The password reset page should be secure and only accessible via the unique link in the email. The password reset page should include clear and concise instructions on how to reset a password. The password reset page should include a form for users to enter a new password and confirm it. The new password should meet the password policy requirements. Upon submitting the new password, the system should verify that the password meets the policy requirements and update the user's password. After successfully resetting the password, the user should be redirected to the login page with a message indicating that their password has been reset. If the user does not submit a valid new password or if there is an error, the system should display an error message indicating the problem.

Acceptance Criteria: The password reset link should be valid for a limited amount of time, such as 24 hours, after which it should expire and become invalid. If a user clicks on an expired password reset link, they should receive an error message indicating that the link is no longer valid and they need to request a new link. The expiration time for the password reset link should be clearly communicated to the user in the password reset email and on the password reset page. The password reset functionality should be tested to ensure that the expiration time is working as expected and providing a positive user experience.

5.	As a registered user, I want to receive an error message if I enter an incorrect email address or the email address does not exist in the system.
Acceptance Criteria: If the user enters an incorrect email address or the email address does not exist in the system, an error message should be displayed indicating that the email address is invalid or not found. The error message should be clear and concise, explaining the problem to the user and providing guidance on what to do next. If the user enters a valid email address, the password reset email should be sent to that email address.

6.	As a registered user, I want to receive a confirmation message once I have successfully reset my password.
Acceptance Criteria: Once the user has successfully reset their password, a confirmation message should be displayed indicating that their password has been updated. The confirmation message should be clear and concise, informing the user that their password has been successfully reset and providing guidance on what to do next. The confirmation message should also include any other relevant information, such as instructions on how to log in with the new password. If the user encounters any errors during the password reset process, an error message should be displayed instead of the confirmation message. The password reset functionality should be tested to ensure that the confirmation message is working as expected and providing a positive user experience.

7.	As a registered user, I want to be able to log in with my new password once I have reset it.
Acceptance Criteria: Once the user has successfully reset their password, they should be able to log in using their new password.

The login functionality should be tested to ensure that the user is able to log in with their new password after resetting it.

8.	As a registered user, I want to be able to see the strength of my new password and be provided with guidelines for creating a strong password.
Acceptance Criteria: When the user enters a new password, a password strength meter should be displayed indicating the strength of the password. The password strength meter should provide clear and concise guidance on what makes a strong password and how the user can improve the strength of their password. The password strength meter should be based on industry-standard best practices for password security. If the user's password is not strong enough, an error message should be displayed indicating that the password is weak and providing guidance on how to create a stronger password. The password strength functionality should be tested to ensure that the strength meter is accurately assessing password strength and providing clear guidance on how to improve it.

9.	As a registered user, I want to be able to reset my password from my mobile device or tablet in a user-friendly and responsive way.
Acceptance Criteria: The password reset functionality should be fully responsive and work on a variety of mobile devices and tablets.

The password reset functionality should be tested on a variety of mobile devices and tablets to ensure that it works as expected on all platforms.

10.	As a registered user, I want to be able to choose to receive the password reset link via SMS message in addition to email for added security and convenience.
Acceptance Criteria: The user should be presented with the option to receive the password reset link via SMS message in addition to email. If the user chooses to receive the password reset link via SMS, they should be prompted to enter their mobile phone number. The system should validate that the phone number entered by the user is a valid and active phone number. Once the user has entered their phone number, the system should send a password reset link via SMS message. The SMS message should contain a clear and concise message instructing the user on how to reset their password and a link to the password reset page. The password reset link sent via SMS should expire after a certain amount of time to ensure the security of the user's account. The password reset functionality should be tested on both email and SMS delivery channels to ensure that it works as expected on both platforms.
