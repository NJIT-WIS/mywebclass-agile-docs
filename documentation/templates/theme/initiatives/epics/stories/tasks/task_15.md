Task Title: [Establish a tracking and reporting process for the project performance metrics.]

User Story: ["As a project manager, I want to review project performance metrics on a regular basis so that I can identify areas for improvement."]

Description: This task involves establishing a process for tracking and reporting project performance metrics. The goal is to provide a mechanism for monitoring progress against established goals and objectives, and to facilitate decision-making and problem-solving during the course of the project.

Effort Estimate: 3 hours

Assigned To: Project Manager

Priority: Medium

Status: Not started

Notes: The Project Manager will work with the team to determine the appropriate metrics to track, the frequency of reporting, and the format of reports. The tracking process will need to be automated as much as possible to reduce the workload on the team, and any issues with data collection or reporting will need to be addressed as they arise. The reporting process should be designed to facilitate communication among team members and stakeholders, and should be flexible enough to accommodate changes in project goals and objectives over time.
