Task Title: [Identify the requirements for the local environment to match the production environment as closely as possible.]

User Story: ["As a developer, people want to be able to create automated tests that can be run quickly and easily, so that developers can catch issues early on and improve productivity."]

Description: The task involves identifying the requirements for the local environment that will match the production environment as closely as possible. The goal is to ensure that the local environment is similar enough to the production environment that the software can be tested locally without issues, and any bugs can be identified and fixed before deployment to the production environment.

Effort Estimate: 2 hours

Assigned To: DevOps team member

Priority: Medium

Status: Not started

Notes: The DevOps team member will need to work closely with the development team to ensure that all requirements are identified and implemented. It may also be necessary to set up virtual environments or use containerization tools to ensure that the local environment matches the production environment as closely as possible.
