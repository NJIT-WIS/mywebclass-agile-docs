Task Title: Test the Google Analytics tracking code and ensure that it is properly collecting and reporting data.

User Story: "As a project stakeholder, I want to measure user behavior on the site using Google Analytics, so that we can improve the user experience and track our progress."

Description: This task involves testing the Google Analytics tracking code to ensure that it is properly installed on the website and collecting accurate data. This includes verifying that the tracking code is firing on all pages, tracking relevant events and conversions, and checking that data is being reported accurately in the Google Analytics dashboard.

Effort Estimate: typically 3-5 hours of effort, depending on the size and complexity of the website and the number of events and conversions being tracked

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: Med-High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* It's important to test the tracking code before launching the website or any marketing campaigns to ensure that data is being collected properly.
* This task involves setting up test events and goals on the website and verifying that they are being tracked correctly in Google Analytics.
* The testing process should include different scenarios and user journeys to ensure that all aspects of the website are being tracked accurately.
* Testing should be conducted on different devices, browsers, and operating systems to ensure compatibility and accuracy.
* The time estimate for this task will depend on the complexity of the website and the number of test cases required, but it could range from a few hours to several days.

Testing the Google Analytics tracking code can be automated to some extent using various testing tools and techniques. For example, Google Tag Assistant, a free Chrome extension that helps verify if the Google Analytics tracking code is correctly implemented on the website pages, can be used. Additionally, there are automated browser testing tools like Selenium, TestCafe, or Cypress that can simulate user interactions and verify that the tracking code is collecting and reporting data correctly. However, it's also essential to perform manual testing to ensure that all aspects of the tracking code are working correctly and to validate the accuracy of the data being collected.
