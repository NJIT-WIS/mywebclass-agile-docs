Task Title: Design and implement the new course creation and management system

User Story: 
As a teacher, I want to be able to create and manage my courses easily, so that I can focus on delivering high-quality content and engaging with my students.

Description:
Design and implement a new course creation and management system that allows teachers to easily create and manage their courses. The system should include a user-friendly interface for creating new courses, adding course materials and resources, setting assignments and assessments, and tracking student progress. The system should also allow teachers to easily manage their courses, including adding or removing students, tracking attendance, and monitoring student performance. Acceptance criteria include:

A user-friendly interface for creating new courses, adding course materials and resources, setting assignments and assessments, and tracking student progress.
An easy-to-use dashboard for managing courses, including adding or removing students, tracking attendance, and monitoring student performance.
Integration with the school's student information system (SIS) to automatically enroll students in courses.
Ability to export grades and student performance data to the SIS.
Ability to customize the course layout and design.
Robust security features to protect course content and student data.
Comprehensive documentation and training materials for teachers and administrators.

Effort Estimate: 80 hours

Assigned To: John Smith

Priority: High

Status: In Progress

Notes: John will work closely with the school's IT department to ensure that the new course creation and management system integrates seamlessly with the school's existing technology infrastructure. He will also collaborate with teachers and administrators to gather feedback and incorporate their suggestions into the design of the system.

#Testing Plan
##Automatic testing methods that could be used for this task using Python include:

Unit testing: This involves testing individual components of the system to ensure they function correctly. Python has a built-in unit testing framework called unittest, which can be used to write and run unit tests.

Integration testing: This involves testing the interaction between different components of the system to ensure they work together correctly. Python has several frameworks for integration testing, such as pytest and nose.

Functional testing: This involves testing the system's functionality from an end-user perspective. Python has several frameworks for functional testing, such as Selenium and Robot Framework.

Performance testing: This involves testing the system's performance under different load conditions. Python has several frameworks for performance testing, such as Locust and PyTest-Benchmark.

##Some manual testing methods that could be used for this task include:

Exploratory testing: This involves exploring the system to identify any issues that may not have been caught by automatic testing. It can be performed manually by experienced testers.

User acceptance testing (UAT): This involves having end-users test the system to ensure it meets their needs and expectations. It can be performed manually by the school's teachers and administrators.

Regression testing: This involves testing the system after changes have been made to ensure that existing functionality still works correctly. It can be performed manually by the testing team.
