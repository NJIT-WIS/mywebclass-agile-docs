Task Title: [Design a user interface to display product reviews and ratings.]

User Story: ["As a customer, users want to be able to see product reviews and ratings from other customers, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions."]

Description: Design a user interface to display product reviews and ratings. The task involves designing a user-friendly interface that will display reviews and ratings data in an intuitive and visually appealing way. The acceptance criteria include that the interface should clearly display the product name and image, the average rating, and the individual reviews with ratings, timestamps, and helpfulness votes. The interface should also allow users to sort and filter the reviews based on their preferences.

Effort Estimate: 16 hours

Assigned To: UI/UX Designer

Priority: High

Status: In progress

Notes: The designer will need to work closely with the product team to ensure that the interface accurately reflects the product features and user needs. They should also test the interface with users to ensure it is easy to use and meets their expectations. Any technical dependencies should be identified and addressed early in the design process. Once the interface is designed, it will need to be reviewed and approved by the product team before implementation. The designer should also create clear documentation for the interface to make it easier for other team members to use. The interface design should also consider the overall branding and design language of the product.
