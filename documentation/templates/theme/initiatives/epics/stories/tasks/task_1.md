Task Title: [Design a user-friendly interface to display the filter options.]

User Story: ["As a customer, users want to be able to filter products based on various criteria, such as price, size, color, etc., so that I can easily find what I am looking for."]

Description: Design a user-friendly interface to display the filter options. The interface should allow users to easily access and apply the filter options to the product reviews and ratings data. The acceptance criteria include that the interface should be visually appealing, intuitive, and easy to use. The interface should also provide clear and concise feedback to users when they apply a filter option, such as displaying the number of reviews that match the filter criteria.

Effort Estimate: 10 hours

Assigned To: UI/UX Designer

Priority: High

Status: In progress

Notes: The designer will need to work closely with the product team to ensure that the filter options are accurately reflected in the user interface and API. They should also test the filter options with users to ensure they are working correctly and meet their needs. Any technical dependencies should be identified and addressed early in the design process. Once the interface is designed, it will need to be reviewed and approved by the product team before implementation. The designer should also create clear documentation for the interface to make it easier for other team members to use.
