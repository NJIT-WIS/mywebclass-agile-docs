#Testing Plan
##For manual testing, a tester can perform the following tests:

Functional testing: Test each search and filter function and verify that it returns relevant results based on the search query or filter criteria.

Usability testing: Test the search and filter functions to ensure that they are easy to find and use on the website.

Compatibility testing: Test the search and filter functions on different web browsers, devices, and screen sizes to ensure that they work properly across all platforms.

Performance testing: Test the search and filter functions to ensure that they do not slow down the website's performance.

##For automated testing, Python can be used to create test scripts that automate the testing process. Some of the automated tests that can be performed using Python include:

Unit testing: Test individual search and filter functions to ensure that they work as intended.

Integration testing: Test how the search and filter functions interact with other website features.

Regression testing: Test the search and filter functions after changes or updates have been made to the website to ensure that they still work properly.

Load testing: Test the search and filter functions to determine how many users the website can handle at once.
