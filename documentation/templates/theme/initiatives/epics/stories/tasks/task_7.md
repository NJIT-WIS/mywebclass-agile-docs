User Story: ["As a developer, people want to be able to create automated tests that can be run quickly and easily, so that developers can catch issues early on and improve productivity."]

Description: The task involves developing a script or tool to automate the deployment process. The tool will be used to deploy code changes and configuration updates to the production environment without manual intervention. The tool should be reliable, efficient, and easy to use.

Effort Estimate: 10 hours

Assigned To: DevOps team member

Priority: High

Status: In progress

Notes: The DevOps team member will need to work closely with the development team to ensure that the deployment tool can handle code changes and configuration updates seamlessly.
