Task Title: [Develop a version control system to manage updates and changes to the web page template.]

User Story: ["As a web developer, users want to regularly update and maintain the web page template to ensure it remains functional and bug-free."]

Description: The task involves developing a version control system to manage updates and changes to the web page template. The goal is to ensure that all changes are tracked and recorded, and that different versions of the web page template can be easily accessed and deployed as needed.

Effort Estimate: 3 hours

Assigned To: DevOps team member

Priority: Medium

Status: Not started

Notes: The DevOps team member will need to work closely with the development team to determine the best version control system to use, and to set up the system and train the team on how to use it. It may also be necessary to establish guidelines for branching, merging, and code reviews to ensure that the version control system is used effectively. The use of a version control system will help to prevent conflicts and errors in the code, and will make it easier to roll back changes if necessary.
