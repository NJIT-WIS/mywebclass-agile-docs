#Testing Plan
##Automated Testing
Automated testing may also be used to check that the section is only accessible to authenticated users and that it can be accessed from any page related to the course. Both unit and integration testing may be required to ensure that the new section is functioning correctly and has been integrated properly with the existing codebase. The testing may involve the use of Python frameworks like Selenium, Pytest, and Unittest.
