Task Title: Integrate the Google Analytics tracking code into the website.

User Story: "As a project stakeholder, I want to measure user behavior on the site using Google Analytics, so that we can improve the user experience and track our progress."

Description: The task involves adding the tracking code obtained from the Google Analytics account to the website's code so that user behavior can be tracked. 

Effort Estimate: approx. 1-2 hours, depending on the website's technical setup and the familiarity of the person with website development

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* The tracking code should be placed in the head section of all pages on the website to ensure accurate tracking of user behavior.
* The code should be implemented in a way that does not slow down the website's load time or negatively impact its performance.
* It is important to test the implementation thoroughly to ensure that the tracking is accurate and all necessary data is being captured.
* If the website has multiple domains or subdomains, the tracking code may need to be customized to ensure that data is being tracked correctly for each domain/subdomain.
* It may be necessary to work with the development team to ensure that the code is implemented correctly and that there are no conflicts with other scripts or plugins on the website.
