Task Title: [Set up a development environment that mirrors the production environment.]

User Story: ["As a developer, people want to be able to easily deploy the current development branch to my local environment, so that I can review and test changes more efficiently."]

Description: The task is to set up a development environment that mirrors the production environment to ensure that code developed in the development environment works seamlessly when deployed to production.

Effort Estimate: 2 hours

Assigned To: DevOps team member

Priority: Medium

Status: Not started

Notes: The DevOps team member will work closely with the development team to ensure that the development environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. The task involves identifying and installing the necessary tools and technologies, such as web servers, databases, and other required software. It may also involve setting up virtual environments or using containerization tools.
