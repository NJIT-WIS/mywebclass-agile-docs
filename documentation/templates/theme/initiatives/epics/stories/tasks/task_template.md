Task Title: [Identify the filter options that will be available to the user.]

User Story: ["As a customer, users want to be able to filter products based on various criteria, such as price, size, color, etc., so that I can easily find what I am looking for."]

Description: Identify the filter options that will be available to the user. The task involves reviewing the product features and identifying the key attributes that users would want to filter reviews by, such as rating, date, relevance, and helpfulness. The acceptance criteria include that the filter options should be intuitive and easy to use, and they should help users find the information they need quickly and easily.

Effort Estimate: 6 hours

Assigned To: Product Manager

Priority: Medium

Status: Completed

Notes: The product manager will need to work closely with the design and development teams to ensure that the filter options are accurately reflected in the user interface and API. They should also test the filter options with users to ensure they are working correctly and meet their needs. Any technical dependencies should be identified and addressed early in the design process. Once the filter options are identified, they will need to be reviewed and approved by the product team before implementation. The product manager should also document the filter options to make it easier for other team members to use.
