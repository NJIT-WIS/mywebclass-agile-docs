Task Title: Determine if the website is collecting personally identifiable information (PII) and if so, ensure that it is being handled in compliance with relevant laws and regulations

User Story: "As a team member, I want to ensure that we legally use Google Analytics on the website, so that we don't violate any laws or regulations."

Description: This task involves reviewing the website and determining if any personally identifiable information (PII) is being collected through Google Analytics. If PII is being collected, the team must ensure that it is being handled in compliance with relevant laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

Effort Estimate: 8-10 hours, depending on the complexity of the website and the extent of PII collection

Assigned To: [Assign the task to a team member who will be responsible for completing it]

Priority: Medium-High

Status: Not started

Notes:
* The first step would be to identify the data being collected by Google Analytics on the website. This would include both the standard data collected by Google Analytics (e.g. page views, time on page, device type), as well as any custom data being collected by the website owner (e.g. user email addresses, names, or other personal details).
* Once the data being collected is identified, it will need to be determined whether any of it qualifies as personally identifiable information (PII) according to relevant laws and regulations (e.g. GDPR, CCPA). Examples of PII may include names, email addresses, phone numbers, or IP addresses.
* If PII is being collected, steps should be taken to ensure that it is being handled in compliance with relevant laws and regulations. This may include obtaining user consent, providing users with the ability to opt out of data collection, or taking other measures to protect user privacy
