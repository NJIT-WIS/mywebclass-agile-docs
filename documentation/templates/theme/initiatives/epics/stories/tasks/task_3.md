Task Title: [Create an API to fetch and display reviews and ratings data on the product page.]

User Story: ["As a customer, users want to be able to see product reviews and ratings from other customers, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions."]

Description: Create an API to fetch and display reviews and rating data on the product page. The task involves creating an API that will retrieve review and rating data from the database and format it in a way that can be easily displayed on the product page. The acceptance criteria include that the API should be scalable and able to handle a large volume of requests. The data should also be cached to reduce the load on the database. The API should return the product name and image, the average rating, and the individual reviews with ratings, timestamps, and helpfulness votes.

Effort Estimate: 12 hours

Assigned To: Backend Developer

Priority: High

Status: In progress

Notes: The developer will need to work closely with the database team to ensure that the API can efficiently retrieve the data. They should also create clear documentation for the API to make it easier for other team members to use. The API should be tested thoroughly to ensure it can handle a large volume of requests without slowing down the website. Any technical dependencies should be identified and addressed early in the development process. Once the API is developed, it should be reviewed and approved by the product team before implementation.
