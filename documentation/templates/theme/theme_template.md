Theme: Empowering students with hands-on experience on a Techified Platform

"As a student, I want to learn about modern software development technologies and processes in a hands-on learning environment so that I can prepare myself for the workforce. By creating a platform that provides an integrated learning experience that contextualizes technology with business processes, we can help students develop practical skills and gain real-world experience. This will enable us to better prepare students for success in the modern workforce thus encouraging creativity and innovation. By following lean and agile methodology, we can quickly and effectively develop a MyWebClass.org website template that satisfies all technical and legal requirements to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in search engines by implementing the basic on-page SEO requirements, setting us up for a high-quality educative platform that empowers students with skills and knowledge"
