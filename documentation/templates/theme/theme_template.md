As a student, I want to be able to access and read articles so that I can 
learn more about a specific topic and improve my understanding of the material. With easy access to 
articles, I can learn at my own pace and review material as needed. This will allow me to better prepare 
for exams and develop a deeper understanding of the subject. By following best practices for presenting articles
in an organized and easy-to-navigate format, the website is able to deliver content quickly and effectively, setting us up for success in our studies.
