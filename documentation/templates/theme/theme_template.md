"As an educator, I want to offer a comprehensive list of courses in software engineering and advanced technologies, so that my students can gain practical skills and stay ahead in the industry. By designing an engaging and user-friendly Courses Page, we can improve the user experience and attract more students to our platform. This will enable us to provide high-quality education and enhance the learning experience for our users. By following agile development principles and user-centered design methodology, we can quickly and effectively create a range of courses that meet the needs of our users, setting us up for long-term success."
