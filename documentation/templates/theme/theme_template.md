# Theme

The focus will be around identifying user needs. We need to start by identifying the needs and expectations of the users. Some of the methods that we can 
use are techniques like user interviews, surveys and user testing to get a better understanding of what our users are looking for. This allows us to make 
less mistake on initiating things and responses from the users can quickly translate into trials for further testing. This gives us the data that will
ultimately benefit long-term wise. We should be ones asking the questions!
