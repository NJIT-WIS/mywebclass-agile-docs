## Lean Plan:

* Identify the core value proposition of the web project and the minimal set of features needed to deliver it.
* Build a prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that can be tested and validated with users.
* Focus on delivering the highest value features first, and continuously prioritize and refine the backlog based on user feedback and business goals.
* Adopt a continuous delivery and deployment approach to quickly deliver new features and updates to users.
* Encourage collaboration and communication among team members, and eliminate waste and non-value-added activities.
* Measure and track key performance indicators (KPIs) to assess the effectiveness and impact of the web project, and use the data to inform decision-making and improvement efforts.
* Continuously experiment and iterate based on user feedback, market trends, and emerging technologies to ensure that the web project stays relevant and competitive.
