# Test Plan: 

### Objective The objective of this test plan is to verify that the website's privacy policy conforms to GDPR regulations and that users' personal data is handled appropriately and securely.

### Scope: This test plan will focus on the following aspects of the website's privacy policy:

###  Accessibility: Is the privacy policy easily accessible to users?
### Accuracy: Does the privacy policy accurately reflect the website's data handling practices?
### Consent: Does the website obtain user consent for data collection and processing?
### Data retention: Does the website retain user data for a limited time and delete it when no longer necessary?
### Data security: Is user data handled securely and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure?
### Testing Strategy: The testing strategy for this test plan will be manual testing in a development environment. A QA tester will navigate through the website and examine the privacy policy and data handling practices.

### Test Cases: Verify that the privacy policy is prominently displayed and easily accessible from
