<User Identification> Start by identifying the user who will benefit from the feature or functionality. This could be an end-user or a stakeholder.

<Define the goal> Clearly define the goal or objective of the user story. This should be specific, measurable, and achievable.

<Describe the need>  Describe the user's need or problem the story addresses. This should be in the user's own words and focus on the "why" rather than the "how."

<dentify acceptance criteria> Define the acceptance criteria for the story. This describes the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete.
